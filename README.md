# ***process-management-in-linux***

## ***📌 Overview -***:
          This repository contains the deliverables for ***Process Management in Linux***. The goal of this task is to demonstrate the ability to manage and control system processes confidently using both the Linux CLI and optional GUI tools.

## ***🛠️ Tools Used -*** : 
        - *Primary:* Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) 
        - *Alternative:* `systemctl` GUI (e.g., GNOME Services)

## ***🧾 Hints / Mini Guide*** :  
        1. *List running processes* using `ps`, `top`. 
        2. *Kill processes* using `kill` and `kill -9`. 
        3. *Understand process states* (R, S, D, T, Z). 
        4. *Start and stop services* using `systemctl`. 
        5. *Enable services at boot* using `systemctl enable`. 
        6. *Monitor resource usage* (CPU, memory, I/O, network). 
        7. *Record findings* in a structured report.

## ***🎯 Deliverables*** : - *Process Management Report* (`process_management_report.md`)
                            - *Process Management Outputs* ('Video and PDF file') 

## ***✅ Final Outcome By completing this task, the intern demonstrates*** :
         - Ability to list and interpret running processes.
         - Confidence in sending signals to processes (`SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`).
         - Understanding of process states (running, sleeping, zombie, etc.). 
         - Competence in managing services (`systemctl start/stop/restart/reload`). 
         - Skill in enabling services at boot. - Monitoring and analyzing resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O, network).
         - Recording and documenting findings in a professional format.
