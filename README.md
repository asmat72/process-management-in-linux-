#*** process-management-in-linux***

##*** 📌 Overview -*** : This repository contains the deliverables for ***Process Management in Linux***. The goal of this task is to demonstrate the ability to manage and control system processes confidently using both the Linux CLI and optional GUI tools.

##*** 🛠️ Tools Used -*** : - **Primary:** Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) 
                            - **Alternative:** `systemctl` GUI (e.g., GNOME Services)

##*** 🧾 Hints / Mini Guide*** : 1. **List running processes** using `ps`, `top`. 
                                 2. **Kill processes** using `kill` and `kill -9`. 
                                 3. **Understand process states** (R, S, D, T, Z). 
                                 4. **Start and stop services** using `systemctl`. 
                                 5. **Enable services at boot** using `systemctl enable`. 
                                 6. **Monitor resource usage** (CPU, memory, I/O, network). 
                                 7. **Record findings** in a structured report.
##*** 🎯 Deliverables*** : - **Process Management Report** (`process_management_report.md`)
                            - **Process Management Outputs** ('Video and PDF file') 

##*** ✅ Final Outcome By completing this task, the intern demonstrates*** :
                                - Ability to list and interpret running processes.
                                - Confidence in sending signals to processes (`SIGTERM`, `SIGKILL`).
                                - Understanding of process states (running, sleeping, zombie, etc.). 
                                - Competence in managing services (`systemctl start/stop/restart/reload`). 
                                - Skill in enabling services at boot. - Monitoring and analyzing resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O, network).
                                - Recording and documenting findings in a professional format.
